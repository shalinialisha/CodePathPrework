## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

### What favorites apps are based off of their designs & why:
- Apple Weather app
    - This app is so beautifully designed! I love how the entire background changes depending on the weather in your area. Even the widgits are transparent so you can see the background through them. I'm also in awe of how they made complicated and colorful weather charts align so well with their design
- Pintrest
    - They have a very satisfying UI. I love how new functions are seamlessy integrated into the app! For example, the choosing your skintones when looking up makeup recommendations. 
- Google Calendar 
    - I really enjoy the small, thoughful details like being able to drag an event to another day or time. It saves the user from the inconvience of making a new event or having to travel to a new page to edit the time of their event. 

### An app I would redesign:

I wish the Notion mobile app looked better. I love the desktop version, but the mobile version is lacking funtionality. I think a great place to start would be considering funtions that Notion has and what that would traslate into as a mobile app. For example, splitting a page into columns doesn't really work in the mobile version. What if they were rows instead? Since people's main goal when using columns is to seperate out information, rows could provide this same benefit. I also think that pictures should be better formatted within the app. Fine-tweaking the proportonality of the image and the page it's in would be useful.
